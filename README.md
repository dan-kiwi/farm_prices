# PastureMarket

At the moment, the website serves to display the current market price of farm commodities. However, it's still under development, with numerous bugs and does not accurately reflect current market prices.

Initially, this project began as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the University of Canterbury's Enterprise Challenge, which is a start-up accelerator program. Through the program, the long-term vision for the site was to evolve into an online marketplace where farmers can trade commodities such as grains and livestock.
